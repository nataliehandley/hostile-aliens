This is my Hostile Aliens game written using Object Orientated Programming. I created an "Alien" class for all of the alien ships, then extended the class to create "Defence Ships", "Attack Ships" and the "Mother Ship".
It has been challenging but fun! I have written some simple tests as well to test the game
